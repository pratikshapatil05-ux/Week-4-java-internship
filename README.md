# Week-4-java-internship
The Employee Management System is a Java-based console application that demonstrates. It allows users to store, manage, and retrieve employee data efficiently. The project integrates ArrayList and HashMap for dynamic storage and quick lookups, and it uses file persistence to save data permanently.

**#Key Features:**

Add, update, view, and delete employee records (CRUD operations).

Search employees by ID, name, or department.

Store employee information using ArrayList.

Quick employee lookup using HashMap.

Save and load employee data from text files.

Handle exceptions to prevent program crashes.

Manage employee join dates and generate simple reports (e.g., total salary).

**#Theory Concepts Covered**

This project demonstrates the following Java concepts:

*ArrayList (Dynamic Arrays):
Used to store multiple employee objects dynamically.

*HashMap (Key-Value Pairs):
Enables fast employee lookup by ID.

*File Handling:
Employee data is saved and retrieved from text files.

*Exception Handling:
Ensures the program continues running even if errors occur (e.g., invalid input).

*Dates and Times:
Stores employee join dates using LocalDate for date-related operations.
